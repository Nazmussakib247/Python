# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This section introduces the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, allowing you to structure your code using objects and classes.

## Contents

-   `23_Classes_Objects.py`: Defining classes and creating objects (instances) of those classes.
-   `24_Inheritance.py`: Implementing inheritance to create new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reusability.
-   `26_Polymorphism.py`: Understanding and implementing polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way.

## How to Use

Work through the examples to grasp the concepts of classes, objects, attributes, and methods. Understand how inheritance allows for code extension and how polymorphism enables flexible and adaptable code.
