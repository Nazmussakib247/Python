# Python Control Flow

This section focuses on the control flow statements in Python, which allow you to dictate the order in which code is executed based on certain conditions or for repetitive tasks.

## Contents

-   `17.0_If.....Else.py`: Implementing conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
-   `17.1_Match.py`: Introduction to the `match` statement (available in Python 3.10+), providing a more structured way to handle multiple conditions.
-   `18_While_Loops.py`: Creating and using `while` loops for repeated execution based on a condition.
-   `19_For_Loop.py`: Iterating over sequences (lists, tuples, strings) and other iterable objects using `for` loops.

## How to Use

Study the examples in each file to understand how to implement different control flow mechanisms in Python. Experiment with different conditions and loop structures to solidify your understanding.
